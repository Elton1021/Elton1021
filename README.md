## 👋 About

Backend Engineer with **5.5+ years** building systems that handle real-world pressure — from platforms executing burst workloads of **6,109+ daily transactions** to payment systems requiring **sub-1.5s response times** across unreliable networks.

I work primarily with **TypeScript/Node.js (NestJS)** on **AWS**, and use **Go** when performance demands it (e.g., serverless cold-start and latency-critical paths).

- Current: **Software Engineer II @ InCred Money (Pune, India)**
- Open to: **Remote-first roles (global)** or **relocation (Europe/UAE)**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, SQL (plus PHP/Java as needed)  
**Backend:** NestJS, Express, Fastify, gRPC, GraphQL  
**Cloud/Infra:** AWS (Lambda, SQS, S3, EC2, API Gateway, CloudWatch), Docker, Azure Functions  
**Data:** MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, ClickHouse  
**Practices:** Microservices, event-driven systems, queue-based processing, rate-limiting, idempotency, multi-tenant platforms

## 🏆 Highlights (Proof > buzzwords)

- Designed and launched a **bullion trading module (digital gold & silver)** processing burst workloads of **6,109+ daily transactions**
- Built a **dual-queue workflow** to respect partner limits (**20 req/s**) with retries + safe failure handling
- Refactored a monolithic codebase into **independent microservices** and scale-specific components for better reliability and deployability
- Reduced build time by **88.75%** by moving from monolith → **microservices** (improving engineering velocity)
- Improved API performance by **~83%** by shifting heavy workflows to **async processing** (SQS + background jobs)
- Rewrote latency-critical **USSD** backend in **Go on AWS Lambda**, reducing cold start from **~1.5s → ~10ms** and keeping **<1.5s** end-to-end response
- Migrated transaction logging from **Azure Functions → AWS Lambda** in **3 days**, improving debugging speed by **~75%**

## 🚀 Work I’ve Done (selected)

### InCred Money — Partners Platform (B2B2C)
Built partner-facing services with strict uptime and partner constraints (rate limits, idempotency, retries), including a **Bullion trading module** with SIP windows and burst handling.

**Core themes:** multi-tenant platform design, safe retries, queue-driven dispatch, and service decomposition for scale.

---

### Airpay — Payments & Platforms (India + Tanzania)
Built multiple payment modules end-to-end and led performance + architecture improvements across:
- **Airpay Vyaapaar (B2B):** CMS, Shopping/Bazaar, Recharge, ONDC, BBPS ownership
- **Airpay Yako / Wakala / Cards (Tanzania):** reliability under tough network conditions and strict SLAs
- **Global Enterprise logging:** privacy-aware transaction logging and fast migrations

---

### Pirate Alert — Scrapers & Automation
Built scrapers/crawlers for anti-piracy monitoring (web + social workflows), including Puppeteer-based crawlers and mobile automation using **Appium/Selenium**.
